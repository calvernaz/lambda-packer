- existing projects, need a way to just add or read the monorepo configuration
- need to be able to add a new lambda to the monorepo
- build a dockerfile from the lambda configuration without need to provide one
- lambda-packer package should iterate over all lambdas and package
- package_docker when fails leaves layers in the lambda folder
